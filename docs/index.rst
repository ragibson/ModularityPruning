Welcome to ModularityPruning's documentation!
=============================================

ModularityPruning is a pruning tool to identify small subsets of network partitions that are significant from the
perspective of stochastic block model inference.

This method works for single-layer and multi-layer networks, as well as for restricting focus to a fixed number of
communities when desired.

Prior to version v1.3.0, we used the Louvain algorithm for modularity maximization instead of Leiden. The deprecated
module ``modularitypruning.louvain_utilities`` now shims single-layer functions to their corresponding Leiden versions
in ``modularitypruning.leiden_utilities`` (though it still contains the legacy multi-layer functions since they can be
faster in general -- leidenalg does not efficiently implement multilayer optimization).
