Welcome to ModularityPruning's documentation!
=============================================

ModularityPruning is a pruning tool to identify small subsets of network partitions that are significant from the
perspective of stochastic block model inference.

This method works for single-layer and multi-layer networks, as well as for restricting focus to a fixed number of
communities when desired.
